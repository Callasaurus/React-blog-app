# React Blog Application

What's more original than creating a blog app, right? This blog application was made after my first week of learning React. It was great for a bit of practice and for cementing my understanding of React concepts like props and useState. Feel free to run the app, read the blog post and leave a friendly comment. Or don't. It's up to you.
